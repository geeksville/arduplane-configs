The manual is crap and here is how it work.



   Throttle stick position        bottom                   in middle                  	 	 at top
     
1. Brake setting                 | off                    | soft                      		| hard
2. Timing setting                | Low                    | Medium                    		| High
3. Battery Protectio             | High cut-off threshold | Medium cut-off threshold  		| ----- 
4. Plane Mode                    | Fixed-wing aircraft    | Helicopter mode 1(with Soft start)	|Helicoptermode 2(Super-Soft+Govener Mode)
5. Throttle response speed       | normal                 | Medium                    		| High
  setting




Turnigy AE-30A ESC setting

step 1.  Throttle all the way up

step 2.  Switch on transmitter

step 3.  switch on power to esc (To change the setting you should either move the stick in the bottom, middle or top position)

step 4.  its going through a series of beeping processes, wait untill it does not beep at all, only then move the throttle all the way down. 
	 There will be funny beeping untill it stops

Step 5.  Brake setting =	starts with short 1 beeps repeat 5 times and follow by confirmation beeps sound.     

Step 6.  Timing setting =  2 short beeps repeat 5 times and follow by confirmation beeps sound.       
 
Step 7.  Battery Protection setting = 3 short beeps repeat 5 times and follow by confirmation beeps sound.

Step 8.  Plane Mode/ Helicopter mode 1&2 = 4 short beeps repeat 5 times and follow by confirmation beeps sound.

Step 9.  Throttle response speed setting = 5 short beeps repeat 5 times and follow by confirmation beeps sound.

Step 10. loudness of the motor beeping = 6 short beeps repeat 5 times and follow by confirmation beeps sound.

Step 11. wait until the confirmation beep is finnished then disconnect the battery.

step 12. Move  your throttle to the bottom and plug in your ESC's battery. The ESC will confirm that it is connected to the transmitter and 
         the throttle is in bottom. DO NOT MOVE THE THROTTLE UP YET, you need to confirm that your ESC was setup correctly. Now the ESC will 
         beep through menu 1-5 starting with your menu 1 which is your brake setting and end with menu 5 which is your throttle response

If after step 12 confirm you have program wrongly, just go through the steps above good luck!
